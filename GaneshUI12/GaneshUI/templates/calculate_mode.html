                        The arithmetic mode, often simply referred to as the mode, is a measure of central tendency that represents the
                        value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is particularly useful in statistics for understanding the
                        most common value in a set of data, especially when the dataset contains repeated values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        To find the mode, you need to identify the value(s) that occur most frequently in the dataset. A dataset may have
                        one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all if all values occur with the
                        same frequency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        For example, consider the following set of numbers: 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5. To calculate the mode:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        1. Identify the frequency of each number:
                  <ul>
                        <li>1 appears 1 time</li>
                        <li>2 appears 2 times</li>
                        <li>3 appears 1 time</li>
                        <li>4 appears 3 times</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>5 appears 1 time</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        2. The number that appears most frequently is <strong>4</strong>, which occurs 3 times. Therefore, the mode of
                        this dataset is <strong>4</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        Now consider another example with the numbers: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4. To find the mode:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        1. Identify the frequency of each number:
                  <ul>
                        <li>1 appears 1 time</li>
                        <li>2 appears 2 times</li>
                        <li>3 appears 2 times</li>
                        <li>4 appears 1 time</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        2. In this case, both <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> appear most frequently (2 times each). Therefore,
                        this dataset is bimodal, and the modes are <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>.
                  </p>
