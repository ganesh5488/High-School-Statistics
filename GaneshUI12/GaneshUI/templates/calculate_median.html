                        The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from
                        least to greatest. It is particularly useful in statistics because it is not affected by extreme values
                        (outliers), making it a robust measure of central tendency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        To find the median, the dataset must first be arranged in ascending order. If the number of observations (n) is
                        odd, the median is the value at the middle position. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle
                        values.
                        The formula for calculating the median can be expressed as:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        <strong>Median (M) =
                              {
                              x<sub>(n+1)/2</sub> if n is odd
                              }
                              or
                              {
                              (x<sub>(n/2)</sub> + x<sub>(n/2 + 1)</sub>) / 2 if n is even
                              }</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        For example, consider the following set of numbers: 3, 1, 4, 2, and 5. To calculate the median:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        1. First, arrange the numbers in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        2. Since there are 5 numbers (an odd count), the median is the middle value, which is the third number:
                        <strong>3</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        Now consider another example with an even number of values: 7, 1, 3, and 5. To find the median:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        1. Arrange the numbers in ascending order: 1, 3, 5, 7.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        2. Since there are 4 numbers (an even count), the median is the average of the two middle values: (3 + 5) / 2 =
                        <strong>4</strong>.
                  </p>
